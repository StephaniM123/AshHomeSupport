    <p>Hi,
      Welcome to Ash Home Support.
      This website is designed to be a hub for those either looking to support themselves or for a family member, or just looking for information or to discuss subjects linked to home support.
      As some of you will already know, I am offering a non medical home support service which I started in memory of my beautiful nan Barbara Ash.
      I aim to offer the type of service that gives you peace of mind and helps to give as much independence as possible within the home. I'm fully insured, have a current DBS check and work directly for the client.
      Please feel free to get in touch if you're looking for support or advice.
      More to follow.............</p>
